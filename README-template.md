## Overview

## The Challenge

Build the website and make the logic to calculate the tips.

## My process

### Built with

- JavaScript
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned how to make a website only with javascript and studying the components. I learned how to use some CSS commands like hove and font face.

```css
@font-face {
     font-family: 'Space Mono' ;
     src: url('/SpaceMono-Bold.ttf') format('truetype');
}
button.buttontip:hover {
    background-color: hsl(172, 67%, 45%);
    color: hsl(183, 100%, 15%);
}
```
```js
const body = document.body;
const bigbody = document.createElement('div');
const firstTable = document.createElement('div');
var selecaoTip = 0;
body.appendChild(bigbody);
bigbody.appendChild(firstTable);
```

### Continued development

I'll try to focus on React and javascript in the future now and try to use some frameworks to learn more about the subject and use some functions in future projects like reduce,filter,some, etc...
